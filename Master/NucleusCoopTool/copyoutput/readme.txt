Nucleus Co-op - version 2.4.0

Nucleus Co-op is a free and open source tool for Windows that allows split-screen play on many games that do not initially support it, the app purpose is to make it as easy as possible for the average user to play games locally using only one PC and one game copy.

This is a new and improved official version of the Nucleus Co-op application and is part of the SplitScreen.Me github organization, it includes the following:

1. New and improved options in game handlers:

Note: If you want to create your own handler also read the MasterHandler.js in Nucleus Co-op handlers folder alongside this info.

#################### Game Info ####################

Game.ExecutableName = "Game.exe";                       //The name of the game executable with the extension. This will be used by Nucleus to add games, to run the game and as process to follow for positioning and resizing. 
Game.ExecutableToLaunch = "Game.exe";		        //If the game is to launch a different executable, other than what Game.ExecutableName is.
Game.LauncherExe = "Launcher.exe";                      //If the game needs to go through a launcher before opening Nucleus will use this exe to start the game and it will still use the Game.ExecutableName process for positioning and resizing. 
Game.GUID = "Game Name";                                //The name of the folder that will be created inside the Nucleus content folder (just use letters not symbols). In this folder Nucleus will store the symlinked or copied game files for each instance of the game.

Game.LauncherTitle = "Launcher Window Title";           //The name of the launcher's window title. Some games need to go through a launcher to open. This is needed or else the application will lose the game's window.
Game.MaxPlayersOneMonitor = 4;                          //This is just info. It will not limit the players number.
Game.MaxPlayers = 16;                                   //This is just the max players info that shows under the handler name in Nucleus UI. Usually we write the max number of players the game supports (PC should support 16 max connected input devices).

Changelog: 

v2.4.0 - xxxx, 2025

-New native SDL2 support.

-Added game search and sorting functions.
-New multiple players per instance UI assignation support (Xinput/Proto Xinput, SDL2).
-Added per game "use api index" option in the game options menu, bypasses the general setting. There is a similar option for guest controllers only for handlers with multiple players per instance support.
-New Nucleus_Launcher.exe, a helper to check for .Net framework download and installation.
-The Nucleus Co-op window can now be resized/maximized/minimized without resetting the current setup.
-Fixed the backup function not working if a Nucleus player nickname is equal to the Windows user name.
-Modified backup function so it does not return an error if a file does not exist but skip it instead, better logging too.
-All Nucleus prompts and process pickers will now close automatically on session end, whether manually or due to an error.
-Fixed an UI bug where it was not possible to select the same game after ending a session in some cases.
-Fixed player being deleted if a controller is unplugged during very early handler setup in some cases.

-Added exFat format check for game path and Nucleus installation path.
-Added new option Game.DpiAwarenessMode as a successor to DPIHandling that is now deprecated. DpiAwarenessMode.HighDpiAware is now the default and should fix most instances scaling issues at display scales higher than 100%.
-Moved the "Unlock original game files" function so it executes earlier (some files were copied before its execution).
-Added a new "pass-through locked inputs state" flag to Game.CustomHotkeys.
-It's now possible to use a shorten link in all handler prompts (only one per prompt).

-More OneDrive checks.
-Added installation path in the error window and show if OneDrive is enabled.
-Added installation path and Nucleus Co-op version at the top of the debug log.
-Added Game.ExecutableNames = ["gameExe1.exe","gameExe2.exe","gameExe3.exe"] which allow to choose among many game executables to a add a game to Nucleus. Game.ExecutableName should not be used with it.

-Fixed a handler update bug where the current version was downloaded in place of the latest.
-New optional profile gamepad assignation method by button press, so gamepads can be assigned dynamically/manually when loading a profile, best to use with custom nicknames.
-More QOL improvements on the setup screen and many bug fixes.

v2.3.4 - Jul 23, 2025

-Added new options to `Game.ProtoInput.SetWindowPosHook = true;`: Values: `true`, `Nucleus.SetWindowPosHook.DontResize`, `Nucleus.SetWindowPosHook.DontReposition`.

- Fixed bug in original Nucleus that didn't allow 1 player to be able to start/play a game
- Fixed "one time use" bug in original Nucleus; Nucleus can now be used multiple times in one session by simply pressing the STOP Button in the app OR pressing the newly created hotkey for it: Ctrl+S
- Added a toggle to make the game windows not the top most windows. Useful if you want to use other programs in the background. Hotkey is Ctrl+A. Pressing it will either disable or enable the windows being top most, depending on its current state. This requires Game.GameName in Nucleus game scripts to work.
